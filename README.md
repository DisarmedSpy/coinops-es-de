## **Configuration Options**

- The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE 
- `Theme Variant` - sets the layout used for the sytem gamelist views.  There are 3 variants to choose from:
   - `Default` - Default view that displays system and gamelist metadata for each view
   - `No Hue` - The same as the Default view, but no blue/purple hue is applied to the system and fan art overlays
   - `Simple` - A minimalistic view with no metadata in the system or gamelist views
- `Theme Aspect Ratio` - sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this can be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen (though it should happen automatically).
   - 16:9 and 16:10 are supported
